Introductory Games Studies

This was the first game that I created when I first started at the University of Lincoln.
It is a similar game in nature to Galaga, in that it is an endless scroller in which you control a space ship and must shoot the spaceships coming from the top of the screen.
There are also powerups and a large selection of enemies that are inside the game in different levels.
